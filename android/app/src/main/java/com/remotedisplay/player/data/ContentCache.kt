/**
 * Root-2 caching fixes vs the "stuck downloading / frozen" bug:
 *  - a hard OVERALL [callTimeout] so a slow-drip/stalled download on a HEALTHY socket can't hang
 *    forever (the old client only had a per-read timeout, which a trickle never trips),
 *  - download to a `.part` temp + integrity-check via [CacheValidation] + atomic rename, so a
 *    truncated/interrupted body is NEVER promoted to the cache and played as if whole,
 *  - exact-prefix cache lookup that also excludes in-flight `.part` files.
 *
 * RESUME. Those fixes made a bad download safe; they did not make it possible. Every attempt began
 * at byte 0 and the `.part` was deleted on failure, so on a link that cannot carry a whole asset in
 * one unbroken call — a one-bar 5G site, the case this was reported from — the file NEVER lands.
 * The player then has nothing cached, and a screen with nothing cached shows the waiting state:
 * reported as "the screens go black instead of playing from cache", when the real failure was that
 * the cache could never be filled in the first place. Five minutes of transfer, discarded; back
 * off; five more minutes, discarded; forever.
 *
 * So an interrupted download now KEEPS its `.part` and the next attempt asks for the rest with a
 * Range header. Progress accumulates across attempts and across reboots instead of being thrown
 * away, which is the whole difference between "eventually plays" and "never plays".
 *
 * Two ways a resume could corrupt the cache, both closed:
 *  - the asset changed under us — `If-Range` with the stored validator makes the server answer 200
 *    with the whole body instead of a tail, and we restart from zero.
 *  - the `.part` is longer than the asset — the server answers 416 and we discard it.
 * The completeness check is unchanged in spirit but now counts TOTAL bytes on disk against the
 * total the server declared in Content-Range, not bytes received this attempt.
 *
 * The primary constructor takes the cache dir + client directly so the real download logic is
 * unit-testable (see ContentDownloadTest) against a local server without an Android Context; the
 * [Context] convenience constructor is what the app uses.
