/**
 * Resolves the background-download × reconnect A-bucket bug. Previously every playlist sweep spawned
 * a detached, un-deduped download `thread{}` writing a deterministic `${id}.ext.part` path. On a
 * watchdog / ConnectionGuard reconnect the re-register drove a NEW sweep that started a DUPLICATE
 * download of the same content mid-fetch — two writers racing the shared `.part` (a corrupt file
 * whose byte-count still matched Content-Length, so it passed the integrity check and was promoted),
 * plus orphaned threads piling up across reconnects, resurrecting "stuck downloading" through the
 * reconnect path — the exact failure the caching fix was meant to eliminate.
 *
 * This coordinator makes background downloads reconnect-resilient:
 *  - SINGLE-FLIGHT per contentId: a reconnect's re-sweep never starts a second download for content
 *    already in flight. The in-flight fetch runs on its OWN OkHttp connection (independent of the
 *    socket), so a reconnect underneath it does not interrupt it — it CONTINUES and completes; if
 *    the network drop truncated it, ContentCache's partial detection discards the `.part` and it
 *    cleanly RESTARTS on a later sweep. Never orphaned, never a duplicate racing the `.part`.
 *  - BOUNDED executor: caps concurrent downloads (no thread pileup across reconnects); shutdown()
 *    cancels in-flight work so nothing orphans or pins the Activity.
 *  - BACKOFF with failure memory: a permanently-failing URL backs off exponentially instead of
 *    re-fetching every 60s forever (no retry storm). The screen keeps serving cached content
 *    (screen-resilience is untouched) and the CMS gets one "failed" ack, not a stuck "downloading".
 *
 * Atomic-swap + partial detection are ContentCache's job and are unchanged; this only guarantees a
 * SINGLE writer per `.part` so that guarantee can't be defeated by a concurrent duplicate.
